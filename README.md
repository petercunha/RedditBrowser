This is a little project I hacked together because I noticed that most Reddit image viewer sites weren't very good. Please report bugs and suggest features in the 'Issues' tab.



### Features
- Fully encrypted HTTPS (all non-secure links are filtered)
- Search multiple subreddits at once by seperating your search by commas or spaces
- Responsive design, media elements are positioned to use your full view height.

### Try it out
